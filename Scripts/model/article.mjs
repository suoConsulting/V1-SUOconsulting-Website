    desc1: `In talking of democratic ideals and their earnest execution, we all think of the usual targets. So to is the scenario when we talk of innovation, economic acceleration, beautiful beaches and enthralling nighttime cityscapes - even social prosperity for that matter. Of course, no one is denying that Australia, Switzerland, The UK, USA or Canada should be recused - far from it. These nations have rightly earned their seat at the table. But the family of developed, burly economies also has the one, shy & quiet cousin that has achieved just as much.`,

    desc2:  `<b>This quaint alcove, hidden behind the waterfall, exquisite in i
    ts ecology and diversity is Portugal.</b> <br> <br>

    Portugal has a long, long history of embracing diversity and inclusion. It was one of the first nations in Western Europe to abolish slavery in the 1761. Take a look at any multinational covenant over the last 2 centuries. Take a look at what they seek to ensure and inspire. And hold your country in comparison. This exercise will tell you two things - one, that whether you belong to the eastern hemisphere or western, there is a long way to go; and two, Portugal might very well be the model state that Amnesty, UN & Red Crossstole their preambles from. Lazy jokes aside, Portugal belongs to the elite club of liberal, progressive states that have been a beacon of hope for human rights activists, social workers, creatives and academics.`,

    desc3: ` <b>Portugal comes nowhere near the frequency with which the usual suspects are mentioned in deliberations over institutional efficiency, accountability, eco-sensitive & sustainable growth, diversity, inclusion…the list could go on. But why </b> <br> <br>

    Scandinavian bloc members have long enjoyed the momentum carried by the label, in the sense that not only did their cultural influences evolve into a brotherhood - but even individually, they have reaped immense benefit, that would have otherwise been foregone, had it not been for upwardly mobile fellows on both sides. Together through many peaks and troughs, each of these nations has been doyenne to its neighbour at one point of time or another. This also carried over in both cross-pollination, and the visibility of Portugal’s progressive policies, purely by virtue of the bloc’c existence. Portugal decriminalised reproductive autonomy, LGBTQ inclusion, and rehabilitative were deliberated upon and brought under public purview long before the current flag-bearers. This progressive spirit lives on even today, through policies that support gender equality, immigrant rights, environmental protection, and more.`,

    desc4: ` <h3> STATUS QUO</h3>
    The progressive and flexible policy framework of Portugal has amassed myriad benefits to itself as well as its trading partners. No one can fault the bureaucracy, or anachronistic politics in terms of hindering growth or knowledge assimilation.

  <br> <br> Now let’s get down to the meat & potatoes - Mobility.<br><br>

Portugal is a leader in immigrant integration. It grants citizenship to immigrants' children born in the country and allows immigrants to vote in local elections. Both of these are increasingly rare virtues, and have remained crucial in edifying Portugal’s position in global fora - whether it’s the industry, or the hearts and minds of the people. Typical socio-economic barriers for immigrants, endemic to the developed world, are pleasantly absent here. <br><br>

Portugal has grown by leaps and bounds over the last 3 decades. In 1986, it was the poorest member of the EU. But steady political reforms, educational-vocational revamps, strides in harnessing renewable energy & sustainable development from day one, have borne fruit. Today, Portugal stands as one of the most future-proof markets in the region.<br> <br>

On the HR/labour market side, this economic strengthening has been provided through a fillip to immigrants - though the majority of the population is greying, and reproductive rates are well below the replacement ratio, Portugal’s open-border policies for employment have allowed immigrant-integration like no other nation in the world. This forward-thinking directive has only added to the robust of the economy, ensuring that it doesn’t tumble under the pressure of welfare spending and its decreasing, domestic labour force participation. For a demonstration, one may look at the numbers - GDP/capita has quadrupled from 1990, crossing $30,000 as per the most recent assessment of the IMF. <Br> <br> `,
    desc5: ` <br><h3>StartUps & Upstarts </h3>

    Predictably, these factors have added to the welcoming nature of the country, especially in terms of investments & B2B commerce. Combined with its attractive visa & mobility programmes (Digital Nomad, NHR, D2 etc.), Portugal has become one of the most sought-after destinations among the financially savvy.
    
    With its widespread acceptance of expats, a laid-back & peaceful culture, access to Schengen members, and (to a lesser, yet still vital extent) pleasant weather, the country is witnessing a surge in youthful go-getters from all over the world coming in and adding to the richness of the cultural and economic landscape.
    
    In this sense, the Portuguese economy provides an extremely atypical & rare combination of developed-world infrastructure and emerging-world growth opportunities. This has led to low cost of doing business compared to the usual markets, supplemented by ease of doing business and low cost of living. The governments, on their part, have also aligned the policy framework to facilitate the growth-hunger, with a bevy of subsidies, schemes and tax-breaks for enterprises and the enterprising. The full-scale embrace of the open European market, appreciation of knowledge transfer and congenial regulatory environment have catapulted the nation forward farther than anyone could have imagined. All the anachronistic notions of “small market, limited growth” have been put to rest.

    Domestically, homegrown startups have done exceedingly well too. Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Braga - each have a specialised industrial AoI, and have generated an astounding amount of business flow and top-notch incubation over the last decade.
    
    `,
    desc6: ` <h4> The impact? </h4>
    
    •7 Unicorns have emerged since policy inception, encompassing luxury goods, philanthropy, AI, SaaS, healthcare & fintech - to name a few. Together, they account for a staggering 15% of the national GDP. <br>
    
    •IPNIncubadora, a homegrown setup, has matured into the best IT incubator in the world.<br>
    
    •Lisbon has been labelled “the new Berlin” in the IT StartUp circuit. <br>
    
    •Considered one of the best communication infrastructure models in the world.<br>
    
    •An optimally-tweaked tax regime for FDI & third-country merchants.<br<
    
    •A steady growth of positive business sentiment & investor confidence.<br>
    
    •Reconsideration of the NHR-status programme: overwhelming corporate and stakeholder groups vying for an extension.<br>
    
    Carbon neutral by 2050 and has already made huge strides in renewable energy - hydropower and wind now provide over half of its electricity. Portugal also promotes green business and innovation through initiatives like the Web Summit, the largest tech conference in the world. By prioritising sustainability, Portugal is building a strong economy for the future.<br>
    
     
    
    Exports have skyrocketed as well - Portugal now sells more goods per capita than economic powerhouses like Canada, Italy or Spain. Key industries like engineering, renewable energy technology, textiles, and wine have found global success.<br> <br>
    
    Perhaps most impressively, Portugal has accomplished this economic transformation while maintaining its commitment to social equality and environmental sustainability. It has one of the lowest inequality levels in the developed world. And where some countries see sustainability and growth as competing priorities, Portugal has proven they can advance hand in hand. <br>`,

    desc7: ` <h3>Makings of a Powerful Alliance</h3>

    For example, Portugal has taken bold steps to promote women in business and politics. It was the first country in Europe to have gender parity in government, with women holding 51% of cabinet positions. The country also ranks highly on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index due to laws guaranteeing equal pay, parental leave for both parents, and bans on gender discrimination. As a result, Portugal now has one of the smallest gender pay gaps in Europe. <br> <br>
    
    This balanced and progressive model is exactly what more nations should pursue as we work to build a fairer, greener global economy. And it is why Portugal makes such an ideal partner for cooperation with India.<br><br>
    
    India and Portugal share deep historic and cultural ties that date back centuries. Portugal was the first European power to establish diplomatic relations with India in the 16th century, bringing trade, architecture, language and people between our lands. Many Indian last names like Dias, Fonseca and Mendes are a legacy of the Portuguese presence in Goa and other coastal regions.<br><br>
    
    Even after Portugal's colonial rule ended, our bond endured. India established its embassy in Lisbon in 1947, just months after independence. And over the past few decades, our partnership has blossomed into a truly modern relationship based on mutual understanding and benefit.<br><br>
    
    Bilateral trade has grown tenfold since the year 2000, reaching over $8 billion according to latest data from the Portuguese government. India is now Portugal's largest trading partner in Asia. Key exports from India to Portugal include textiles, chemicals, gems and jewellery, IT services, and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, Portugal ships machinery, vehicles, plastics, and paper products to the Indian market.<br>
    
    Investment flows have also strengthened - Indian companies have invested over $3 billion in Portuguese sectors like engineering, renewable energy, and real estate. And Portuguese firms are major investors in India's booming economy as well, with stakes in infrastructure, mining, and financial services.<br>
    
    Cultural and educational ties continue to deepen relations between our societies. Over 20,000 Indian students study in Portugal each year, enjoying high-quality education at affordable costs compared to other European nations. Meanwhile tourism is a growing area of exchange, as Indians and Portuguese alike discover each other's beautiful landscapes, histories and cuisines.To further unleash the potential in our partnership, I believe Portugal and India should set ambitious new targets for cooperation across key industries of the future. For example, we could aim to double bilateral trade to $16 billion by 2030 through reduced tariffs and coordinated promotion of our goods abroad. <br>`,

  desc1 : ` <h3>Start-ups as a driver of economic growth </h3> <br><br>
  This article aims to explain the fundamentals of startups and their key role as catalysts for
  the nations economic growth. The focus is on exploring the correlations between the
  establishment of startups and the dynamics of the key aspects of economic expansion and
  a brief introduction on the European start-up ecosystem<br><br><br>
  <h4>Introduction</h4> <br><br>
  <p> Businesses are presently scaling growth and development, rising faster than the historical
  rates. The longevity of the world's largest businesses is now an average of 20 years,
  which is a significant drop from the 60 years span of the businesses in the 1950s. This
  change is propelled by disruptive forces, technological advancements, and the effects of
  globalization. Delving into the fundamentals, let us know what a startup is: It is an entity
  identified in advancing, commercializing, and innovating new products, processes, or
  services, driven by intellectual property or technology. Nowadays, Startups play a crucial
  role in fostering innovation and economic expansion, generating employment
  opportunities, and attracting investments on a global scale, impacting both developed and
  developing nations. Today's startups are going to evolve into tomorrow's industry leaders.
  Today, startups are catering to every need of consumers, that is, from B2B to B2C.
  Several sectors that shine include fintech, e-commerce, SaaS(Software as a service),
  D2C(direct to customer), Autotech, and others.</p> <br>`,
  
 

  desc3:` <h4>Role of Start-ups in the growth of the economy of nations.</h4>
  In the global landscape, startups have emerged as a pivotal driver of national economic
  advancement and provided multifaceted contributions for the growth and development of
  countries. Startups play a vital role in job creation by hiring individuals with diverse skill
  sets and demographics. This not only mitigates unemployment but also promotes a
  culture of entrepreneurship and self-reliance.<br><br>
  1
  In India alone, recognized startups have<br><br>
  generated over 10.34 lakh direct jobs which leads to exemplify the tangible benefits for
  the workforce. Furthermore, startups act as dynamic catalysts, propelling economic
  expansion through their innovative services and the creation of employment
  opportunities. Their combination of fresh ideas and technologies into the market
  enhances competitiveness and attracts foreign investment, thereby promoting the overall
  economic landscape.

 
  The relationship between startups and multinational companies (MNCs) are getting
  stronger, with the MNCs often outsourcing work to startups to focus on core
  competencies. Globally, MNCs and Venture Capitalists closely monitor emerging
  startups, for instance, Accenture made a noteworthy investment of 1.35 million dollars in
  Indian startups in the year 2022.<br><br>

  2- Such investments facilitate the substantial growth of
  startups, enabling them to thrive commercially and positively impact both the domestic
  and global markets. The core competence of startups lies in research and development.
  These enterprises engage in the creation of knowledge-based and high-tech products and
  services, positioning themselves as inventors and innovators. By addressing social and
  economic challenges through independent research and development, startups remain at
  the forefront of technological innovation, disrupting traditional industries and introducing
  transformative products and services. Examples such as companies like Uber and Airbnb,
  which have revolutionized the transportation and hospitality sectors respectively. These
  innovations not only enhance convenience in daily life but also reshape our perceptions
  and interactions within these industries. Additionally, startups exhibit a global outlook
  from their inventions, leveraging technology to reach an international customer base and
  establishing diverse, international teams. This globalization also fosters cross-cultural
  awareness and understanding. There are several bilateral trade agreements between
  almost every nation whose trade borders are open globally, such as those between
  EU-India cooperation on research and innovation, as well as EU-India Connectivity
  Partnership and Trade agreement between EU and Switzerland many more clearly states
  the collaborative efforts aimed at promoting the growth of startup ecosystems on a global
  scale <br>

   contribute to the overall innovation and creativity of these ventures. According to the
  startup environment, a significant majority of startup founders in Europe, more than 90%,
  express satisfaction with their current business situations and the rest of the founders are
  anticipating a favorable business development over coming years. It is well noted that the
  European startup ecosystem is known for good and favorable ratings but still there is
  recognition that there is room for improvement. Importantly, there are differences
  between European countries, indicating the need for collaborative initiatives and efforts
  to foster a more unified and robust startup ecosystem across the continent. As the
  European startup scene continues to mature, it remains an exciting and promising arena
  for innovation, investment, and economic growth.
  Concluding the first part of our startup research, in the subsequent parts we will explain
  the country-specific analysis of startups, the significance of legal assistance, and the
  factors contributing to their growth, along with related topics.

  desc4:` <br><br><h4>Insights on the European Startup Ecosystem</h4><br>
  The European startup ecosystem is a dynamic and flourishing area that continues to
  evolve through its innovation, diverse talent, and a growing entrepreneurial spirit. As of
  the latest data, more than half of all startups in Europe are already engaged in
  international markets to take their company to the international stage. As per the report of
  ESM (European Startup monitor report), it is clearly stated that 8 out of 10 startups are
  actively planning further internationalization within the next 12 months. One of the
  strengths of the European startup ecosystem is its diversity. Nearly 12% of startup
  founders and over 30% of their employees come from countries outside the registered
  location of the startup. This diversity brings a variety of perspectives and skills which <br><br>`,
